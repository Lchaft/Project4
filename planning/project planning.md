Project Planning:

My ideal homepage would show glorious pictures of scrunchies with links to then click on articles about scrunchies, where to buy, and more. There will be three models-- a mood model (photos), a scrunchie model (articles), and a product model (links to buy).

The description above is from day one of project week. After begining the coding process and creating three models my vision for how the app would actually come together changed a bit. While my original idea was to have a model for photos called mood, that model actually turned into pages about how to wear scrunchies (aka tutorials). The homepage then became where links to the 3 models were housed and a showcase of scrunchie pictures.

Here are the models:

* Scrunchies
* Moods
* Products

Each models has multiple views:

* Scrunchies

  * a form
  * edit
  * homepage
  * index
  * new
  * show

* Products

  * a form
  * edit
  * index
  * new
  * show

* Moods
  * a form
  * edit
  * index
  * new
  * show

The data for each model was originally housed in its own file and then linked in to the seeds file, but that was causing issues with the data showing up. So the data was moved (annoyingly) into the seeds file.
