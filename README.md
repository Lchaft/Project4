# Project4

My project is called Scrunch Me. This app fulfills a dire need missing on the current interwebs by creating a one stop shop for all things scrunchie content. Your search ends now for articles about scrunchies, photos of people sporting scrunchies, and of course links to buy scrunchies cause duh.

My ideal homepage would show glorious pictures of scrunchies with links to then click on articles about scrunchies, where to buy, and more. There will be three models-- a mood model (photos), a scrunchie model (articles), and a product model (links to buy).
