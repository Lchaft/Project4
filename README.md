# Project4

My project is called Scrunch Me. This app fulfills a dire need missing on the current interwebs by creating a one stop shop for all things scrunchie content. Your search ends now for articles about scrunchies, photos of people sporting scrunchies, and of course links to buy scrunchies cause duh. Let us not forget that everyone could use a good tutorial on how to style that scrunch.

Brief Example:

List of Features / User Stories:

This project has three models that encapsulate a vareity of features and user stories. The homepage is the first flavor of what the app has to offer by showcasing inspiration images of scrunchies as well as links to the other views- articles about scrunchies, where to buy scrunchies, and how to style scrunchies. Once on the scrunchies page, a user can add a new article about scrunchies to the page, edit a current article, or delete it all together. And, of course the ability to click into and read the article itself. This same format repeats itself in the other two models. On the mood and product pages, the user can add, read, edit, and delete.

My ideal MVP has a project that included 1 to 2 models with some CRUD functionality. This project has 3 models with complete CRUD on all 3 pages. Given further time and (lets be honest) skill, I might seek to implement additional models and features. For example, the ability to add more visual elements to the page such as more videos and pictures. I'm not sure how drag and drop technology works, but something like that I feel would add to the user experience. Given the growing interest and market for scrunchies, this app could eventually become a virtual closet of scrunchies for a true devotee.

List of Technologies Used:

This project was built with help of many matcha lattes, a rotating collection of scrunchies, and the soothing voice of Seal. That is all..

JK :)

This project was built using Ruby on Rails and Bootstrap with gems or whatever that means (still not sure)

Installation Instructions / Getting Started:

This is where I'm supposed to add instructions about how you can run my project locally or how you can look at my code, but still I'm pretty sure I just filled what I call a dire need missing on the interwebs I will not be sharing that info cause it's my IP (le duh).

TL;DR:
I only recently learned what this is LOL! BUT if you've gotten to the bottom of this page go ahead and give yourself a pat on the back and then thank me for creating your new fave website.
